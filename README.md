#About me 😎

I'm a big fan of doing something in the field of Rototik and currently working on the basic understanding of controlling the Rotor.

~I'm also learning RUST right now and try to combining it with ROS.~ (Not anymore)

I'm working on on a project which tries to combine AllgeroHand V4 into a UR platform on ros2.

Well, that will be the profile for now,
I may add more thing about me if i find more thing to say.

Anyway, it's nice to meet you here.
Lets make someting different toghter!
