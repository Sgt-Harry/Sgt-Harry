#About me ðŸ˜Ž

I'm a big fan of doing something in the field of Rototik and currently working on the basic understanding of controlling the Rotor.
I'm also learning RUST right now and try to combining it with ROS.

Well, that will be the profile for now,
I may add more thing about me if i find more thing to say.

Anyway, it's nice to meet you here.
Lets make someting different toghter!
